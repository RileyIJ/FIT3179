                The Australian Agricultural industry is a cornerstone of the countries economy, playing a pivotal role in <b>job creation</b> and in the <b>GDP through the large international export market</b>. 
                <br> <br>
                Australia's 3 largest export customers are <b>China</b>, <b>Japan</b>, and <b>The United States</b>, who are collectively responsible for <b>38.7%</b> (agricultural Trade, n.d). of Australia's export income. Australia's major agricultural exports are <b>meat, especially beef</b>, and <b>wheat</b> , which account for <b>24.6% (16.6% beef)</b> and <b>10.9%</b> of the export income respectively.

                The Australian agricultural industry faces ongoing challenges related to resource management, with a focus on <b>land use</b>, <b>water use</b>, and <b>fossil fuel</b> consumption. Land use is a critical concern as the industry competes with urban expansion and conservation efforts, leading to pressure on available agricultural land. In 2020, <b>55%</b> of Australian land use was for agricultural purposes (Snapshot of Australian Agriculture, 2023). 
                 <br> <br>
                The Agricultural industry is also a major factor in the fight against climate change as the balance between food supply and our usage of fossil fuels fights to be made. Agriculture uses vast quantities of fossil fuels, with Australian agricultural practices using <b>2.23ML</b> of diesel in 2019 (thatâ€™s 7 oil tankers worth!).

                    The Australian agricultural industry, particularly in the production of meat products, holds a prominent position on the global stage. Australia is renowned for its high-quality <b>beef and lamb</b>, which are sought after worldwide. However, in recent years there has been a surge in the demand for <b>chicken meat</b> thanks to its versatility, health factors, and cheaper price compared to beef and lamb (see the interactive histogram to the right). The Australian meat industry is <b>set to continue growing</b>, with the number of animals slaughtered projected to continue to increase over the next 5 years (see prospective slaughter rates chart above)
